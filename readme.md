found somone trying to make alittle game they had a few messy functions and a bunch of global vars but sitin in some main. it basicly did not do anyting. and wa clearly more of a outline  ... i decided to make redo almost all of it, into a c++ class system, and aucally make it work.
and make a proper little game, this is not done, i;ll likely work on it more as i feel like it kinda fun to build alittle bits from random somthing found. i made a game board class, and add in ships classes, and a factory settup, and started to devlope the computer compoente setup.
